## 🧠 About Me

- 🔭 Currently working as a **Software Development Intern at Capital Technology Group**, where I help build high-impact solutions with a startup mindset.  
- 🧪 My work spans satellites, finance bots, and projects I can’t publicly talk about (yet).  
- 🌱 Always learning — from quantum theory to React bugs.  
- 📚 I believe engineering should solve real problems and improve lives — not just hit benchmarks.

## 🔐 Current Projects

While I keep a few public repos here to showcase my work, **some of my most exciting projects are currently private** due to:
- ✨ Early-stage secrecy  
- 🤝 Client confidentiality  

So if things look quiet... they’re not. I’m just **plotting something bigger**. Stay tuned.
